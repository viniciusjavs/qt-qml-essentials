### Qt Definition

- From [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Qt):

	Qt is a cross-platform application and widget toolkit that uses standard C++ but makes extensive use of a special code generator (called the Meta Object Compiler, or moc) togheter with several macros to enrich the language.

	Some of its more important **features** include:
	- Running on the major desktop platforms and some of the mobile platforms.
	- Extensive internalization support.
	- A complete library that provides SQL database access, XML parsing, thread management, network support, and a unified cross-platform application programming interface (API) for file handling.

	#### Softwares using the Qt Framework:
	-  Basis of the KDE software community
	-  VLC
	-  VirtualBox
	-  Mathematica
	-  Bitcoin

	#### Summarizing:
	- **Cross-platform** framework.
	- Supports: **SQL**, **XML**, **threading**, **networking**, **file handling**.


- From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)):

	Qt is a free and open-source *widget toolkit* for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware platforms such as Linux, Windows, macOS, Android or embedded systems with little or no change in the underlying codebase while still being a native application with native capabilities and speed.


	#### Toolkit vs. Framework

	- Toolkit
		+ A **library** or a **collection of libraries** containing a set of graphical control elements (called ***widgets***) used to construct the graphical user interface (GUI) of programs.
		+ Most GUI programs created with Qt have a native-looking interface, in which case Qt is classified as a *widget toolkit*.

	- Application Framework
		+ Consists of a software framework (or simply framework) used by software developers to implement the **standard structure** of application software.
		+ It provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and is a universal, reusable software environment that provides **particular functionality** as part of a larger software platform to facilitate the development of software applications, products, and solutions.
