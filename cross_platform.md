### Cross-Platform

Qt allows you to write advanced applications and UIs once, and deploy them across desktop and embedded operating systems without rewriting the source code.

*"Write once, run everywhere as native."*


#### Cross-Platform vs. Native APIs

- Cross-Platform
	+ Can be built for different platforms
	+ It's possible to be used with platform-specific APIs for better compatibility
- Native API (Platform-Specific)
	+ OS specific
	+ Native look-and-feel
